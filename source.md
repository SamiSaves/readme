# Liquid.qihl README

Welcome to Liquid.qihl! This document contains everything you need to know to interact with this server. Please read all of it before posting to `#help-desk`, it will save you and the staff time and questions. Thank you.

## Rules
1. Do not threaten, dox, or ddos.
2. Do not break Discord ToS.
3. Do not play in lobbies when under the minimum rank. You must forfeit (`-refresh` in game  **NOT** in Discord). Only applies to Chessbot games (not in `#intermediate-lobbies-no-bot`, etc). 
4. Do not post lobby passwords in Chessbot lobbies. 
5. Do not share Chessbot passwords. 
     
## Ranks
Lobbies are organized using the following ranks:

- Beginner: `Unknown`+
- Intermediate: `Bishop-1`+
- Advanced: `Bishop-6`+
- Expert: `Rook-1`+
- Master: `Rook-5`+
         
### Checking Ranks
Use these in `#chessbot-commands`, **NOT** in `#help-desk`.

- Check and update your rank (use this to get new roles when you rank up): `!rank` 
- Check someone else's rank (without `[]`): `!rank [@DiscordName#0000]` 
             
## Reporting Players
If you are in danger of demotion from a tier (e.g. You are `Bishop-1`, and playing in `#intermediate-lobbies-eue`) you should wait for your game to complete and your rank to update before you join another game in your current league. If your rank updates before you join your next game, but after you join the Chessbot lobby, and you are below the minimum rank for the league while in game (e.g. you lost your previous game and are now `Knight-9`) you must forfeit the game (by typing `-refresh` in game,  **NOT** in Discord) or be banned from this server. 

Players that experience this in your games, please consider not caring about a one-rank difference in your game. It doesn't have a serious impact, and is often an honest mistake. Making a big deal of these instances is seldom beneficial for anyone. This is not an invitation to do this, however, and we do not condone this behavior. We will be handing out bans for this, so please be careful.

If a player refuses to forfeit (`-refresh` in game,  **NOT** in Discord): Post a screenshot, their Steam Profile URL, and the final Chessbot Lobby message (after the host uses `!start`) to `#player-reports`. This does **NOT** apply to lobbies without Chessbot (e.g. `#intermediate-lobbies-no-bot`); we don't enforce ranks in lobbies without Chessbot.
    
## Finding, Joining, and Hosting Games

Games are arranged through Chessbot. You must enable direct messages from this server to interact with Chessbot. Chessbot will whisper you the password for the lobby on Discord. Copy the password > Open Auto Chess > Lobby List > Find Private Lobbies > Paste Password > Search > Join Lobby. If no lobby shows up, the host may not have created it yet. Click the `refresh` button in the top-right of the page to re-search for the lobby. People can host lobbies in any region. Look at the region before starting in game to see if it's acceptable to you. Use the following commands in `#[rank]-lobbies channels` **ONLY** (e.g. `#master-lobbies`): (without `[]`)

- `!list` to show available lobbies. 
- `!join` to join a lobby if you're in a `#[rank]-lobbies-[region]` channel (e.g. `#intermediate-lobbies-naw`).
- `!join [region]` (without `[]`) to join a lobby if you're in a non-`[region]` channel (e.g. `#beginner-lobbies`).
	- Regions are: `NA`, `SA`, `EUE`, `EUW`, `RU`, `SEA`, and `OCE`
- `!join [DiscordName@0000]` (without `[]`) to join a specific players lobby. 
- `!leave` to leave a lobby. 
- `!lobby [DiscordName@0000]` (without `[]`) to list the players in a players lobby. 
- `!host` to host a lobby if you're in a `#[rank]-lobbies-[region]` channel (e.g. `#intermediate-lobbies-naw`).
- `!host [region]` (without `[]`) if you're in a non-`[region]` channel (e.g. `#beginner-lobbies`).
- `!host [region] [rank-x]` (without `[]`. `rank-x` must be `your-rank` - 2 or lower) to restrict the rank of your lobby. 
- `!lobby` to list the players in your lobby. 
- `!kick [@DiscordName#0000]` (without `[]`) to kick a player from your lobby. 
- `!start` to start your game and close your lobby when the lobby fills (8/8 players). Please wait until everybody has loaded in before starting in game. 
- `!cancel` to close your lobby.
